I saved Ruby from a drugs den in 2009 when she was 3 months old. Ruby taught me the meaning of unconditional love. She was my shadow for 15 and a half years and it was never going to be enough time together. I brought her everywhere with me and when I couldn't bring her with me I often refused to go. She was the light of my life and will continue to be part of my soul. `,

Our beloved Kitty crossed the rainbow bridge yesterday at 12 years of age leaving pawprints on our hearts that will never fade. She was family and a gentle soul who brought warmth and comfort to every day. Though the house feels emptier without her her spirit lives on in every sunbeam and tender memory. Rest easy dear Kitty.`,

    content: `Lady or “Longford Lady” as what she was registered as, was the most beautiful, most kind, most loving pony, pet and friend any girl could ever ask for. She was a home bred which meant she meant the world to us. A winner in the show ring, while also a winner of all our hearts. The day we had to say goodbye was the most pain we have ever felt as a family. She truly was a character. Lady was a carriage pony, but loved going for hacks under the saddle with me. Lady, my girl, sleep well. I love you.

Lady was born out of a mare called Annaghdown Marian. Her sire, Tulira Robuck, a well known Connemara pony sire. Our sweet girl was a beautiful 14.2 grey mare. She was a looker, winning many showing classes. She was champion in the 3yr old filly class in Galway and also champion 3 yr old in Clifden. Lady was also 1st as a foal. She really was the “it girl” in her younger days! Lady loved being out and about, she learned to drive under the carriage and loved going for long drives around Tipperary with her other pony friends, Peg and Meg! Going riding around the roads and down country lane was another thing lady loved. Her ears were always pricked when Ava took her out. She truly enjoyed life. Never sad, always a happy pony who was so cared for and loved for.`,
